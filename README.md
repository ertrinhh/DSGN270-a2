## About my dog, Congee!

Congee is an 11 year old Maltese Shih Tzu mix breed who loves to nap and lounge in the sun.
He loves getting pets and attention from people, but is not so fond of other dogs, especially those who are larger in size. He is quite the homebody, but that's one of the reasons why he is such an easy-going dog.

As a small dog, Congee doesn't need much exercise, which is great when the weather gets colder. In the summer months, as much as he enjoys going outside,intensive exercise is not the best for smaller dogs. They are likely to develop breathing and heart issues when exercised too much, so it's a great idea to bring a backpack to carry them in when they get too tired.

## Quirky things about him:

1. His favorite toy is this little cow we bought him when he was young. He will carry it to sleep with him every night
2. he loves being perched up by the window so he can bark at neighborhood dogs and enjoy the sun
3. He refuses to go outside if it's colder than -15c
4. He sleeps most of the day, however he must be around someone while he sleeps
5. He loves affection from people

This dog breed makes a great companion for those looking for a low maintenance, non-shedding pup! Maltese Shih Tzu's make great apartment dogs, because they are considered a small breed. Their breed ranges from 8-12lbs, and require around 30 minutes of exercise a day. Running around an apartment constantly should be enough exercise, as too much exercise may lead to health issues.

Here are some pro's and con's of the breed.

## Pros

- Low maintenance, minimal walking required
- Hypoallergenic and non-shedding
- Extremely loving and affectionate

## Cons

- Has "small dog syndrome" and will bark at other dogs
- Separation anxiety once attached
- Is a terrible guard dog and will probably not save you from a burglar

Despite the cons, Congee has been a great starter dog for someone who is inexperienced with puppies, and is looking for a low maintenance dog. They can be used as therapy dogs because of their <em>fun, outgoing, lovable</em> personality.

Maltese Shih Tzu's are fairly <strong>inexpensive</strong> dogs. They require minimal brushing, and can be taken in for grooming once every few months for upkeep and nail trimming. Along with that, they do not require any special raw food diet, and only need about 1 cup of kibble a day. In cocmparison to a larger dog, who would eat at least 1-1.5cup's of kibble per meal, their food can last them anywhere from 1-2 months.

Congee is a great dog who will bring joy to anyone he meets. He is the most low maintenance, quiet dog that has brought me so much happiness throughout the years.
